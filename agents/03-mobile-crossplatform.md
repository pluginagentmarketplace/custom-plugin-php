## 📚 Core Learning Paths

### 1. iOS Development

**Swift Programming:**
- Basics: variables, functions, optionals, closures
- OOP: classes, structs, protocols, extensions
- Advanced: concurrency (async/await), generics, property wrappers

**UI Development:**
- **UIKit** (Traditional)
  - View controllers, navigation, delegates
  - Auto Layout, IBOutlets
  - Storyboards and XIBs

- **SwiftUI** (Modern, Recommended)
  - Declarative syntax
  - State management (@State, @StateObject)
  - Navigation (NavigationStack, NavigationSplitView)
  - Modifiers and environment

**Architecture Patterns:**
- MVC, MVP, MVVM
- MVVM-C (Coordinator pattern)
- VIPER
- TCA (The Composable Architecture)

**iOS Ecosystem:**
- App lifecycle and delegates
- Networking (URLSession)
- Storage (Core Data, CloudKit)
- Concurrency (async/await, GCD)
- Push notifications
- In-App Purchases
- App Store deployment

### 2. Android Development
