# Design & UX Skill

Master user experience and product design.

## UX Design Process

### 1. Research & Discovery
- **User Research**
  - User interviews
  - Surveys and questionnaires
  - User testing
  - Analytics review

- **Personas**
  - Archetypal representations
  - Goals and pain points
  - Behaviors and motivations

- **User Journeys**
  - End-to-end user experience
  - Touchpoints and interactions
  - Emotional journey mapping

- **Competitor Analysis**
  - Identify market leaders
  - Best practices and patterns
  - Opportunities for differentiation

### 2. Definition & Strategy
- **Problem Statement**
  - Define the core problem
  - Quantify the opportunity
  - Success metrics

- **User Stories**
  - "As a [user], I want [action], so I can [benefit]"
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Priority and complexity

- **Jobs to be Done**
  - What job is user trying to accomplish
  - Functional, emotional, social jobs

### 3. Ideation & Design
- **Wireframing**
  - Low-fidelity layouts
  - Information architecture
  - User flows

- **Prototyping**
  - Interactive mockups
  - High-fidelity designs
  - Clickable prototypes

- **Design Systems**
  - Component libraries
  - Design tokens
  - Consistency guidelines

### 4. Testing & Iteration
- **Usability Testing**
  - Unmoderated testing
  - Moderated sessions
  - A/B testing
  - Multivariate testing

- **User Feedback**
  - Iterative improvements
  - Design validation
  - Accessibility audit

## UI Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Color Theory**
  - Primary, secondary, accent colors
  - Color psychology
  - Accessible color contrast (WCAG AA/AAA)

- **Typography**
  - Font pairing
  - Hierarchy (size, weight, color)
  - Readability and legibility
  - Line spacing and line length

- **Layout**
  - Grid systems
  - Whitespace and breathing room
  - Alignment and consistency
  - Responsive layouts (mobile-first)

### Interactive Design
- **Microinteractions**
  - Hover states
  - Feedback animations
  - State changes
  - Transitions and duration

- **Gestalt Principles**
  - Proximity
  - Similarity
  - Continuity
  - Figure/ground
  - Closure

- **Affordances**
  - Visual cues for interactions
  - Recognizable patterns
  - Consistency with user expectations

## Accessibility (a11y)

### WCAG 2.1 Standards
- **Perceivable** - Information visible to all
- **Operable** - Keyboard navigable, no seizures
- **Understandable** - Clear language, consistent navigation
- **Robust** - Compatible with assistive tech

### Key Practices
- Alt text for images
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus indicators
- ARIA labels when needed
- Testing with screen readers

### Assistive Technologies
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS)
- Voice control
- Switch access
- Magnification tools

## Design Tools

### Figma (Recommended)
- Cloud-based collaboration
- Components and variants
- Auto Layout
- Prototyping
- Design tokens
- Developer handoff

### Alternatives
- **Adobe XD** - Professional design
- **Sketch** - macOS-focused
- **Penpot** - Open-source alternative

### Prototyping
- **Figma** - Built-in prototyping
- **InVision** - Prototyping and testing
- **Framer** - Code-based prototyping
- **Principle** - Advanced interactions

## Design Systems

### Components
- Button (primary, secondary, variants)
- Input fields
- Cards
- Modals/Dialogs
- Navigation
- Forms
- Tables

### Documentation
- Component specifications
- Usage guidelines
- Do's and don'ts
- Accessibility requirements
- Code examples

### Tokens
- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing
- Shadows
- Border radius
- Z-index

### Benefits
- Consistency across products
- Faster development
- Scalable team collaboration
- Reduced maintenance

## Behavioral Design

### BJ Fogg's Behavior Model
- **Motivation** + **Ability** + **Trigger** = Behavior
- Increase motivation or ability
- Create timely triggers

### Hook Model (Nir Eyal)
1. Trigger (internal/external)
2. Action (easiest behavior in anticipation of reward)
3. Variable Reward (uncertain outcome)
4. Investment (user input to increase commitment)

### Nudge Theory
- Choice architecture
- Default options influence decisions
- Loss aversion (fear of losing > joy of gaining)
- Social proof (influence of others)
- Scarcity (limited availability)

### Engagement Tactics
- **Gamification**
  - Points and badges
  - Leaderboards
  - Progress visualization
  - Challenges and goals

- **Habit Formation**
  - Consistent experience
  - Regular usage patterns
  - Reduced friction

## Responsive Design

### Mobile-First Approach
- Design for smallest screen first
- Progressive enhancement
- Flexible grids and layouts
- Flexible media

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 480px
- Tablet: 481px - 768px
- Desktop: 769px+
- Large desktop: 1025px+

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44x44 pixels
- Adequate spacing between targets
- Prevent accidental clicks

## User Testing

### Moderated Testing
- Remote or in-person
- Facilitate user while using product
- Ask questions and observe

### Unmoderated Testing
- Self-guided experience
- Use tools like UserTesting.com
- Scale testing across users

### A/B Testing
- Compare two design variations
- Measure impact on metrics
- Statistical significance

### Metrics
- Task completion rate
- Error rate
- Time on task
- System Usability Scale (SUS)
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)

## Learning Path

1. Design fundamentals (color, typography, layout)
2. UX research and user personas
3. Wireframing and user flows
4. Prototyping with Figma
5. Usability testing
6. Design systems
7. Accessibility (WCAG)
8. Advanced topics (behavioral design, analytics)

## Design Thinking Process

1. **Empathize** - Understand users and context
2. **Define** - Frame the problem
3. **Ideate** - Generate multiple solutions
4. **Prototype** - Create low-fidelity solutions
5. **Test** - Validate with users
6. **Iterate** - Refine based on feedback
