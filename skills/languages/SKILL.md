# Programming Languages Skill

Master modern programming languages and their ecosystems.

## Languages Covered

### Frontend-Focused
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Web development, ES6+, async/await, types
- **CSS** - Styling, Flexbox, Grid, animations
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup, accessibility

### Backend Languages
- **Python** - Django, FastAPI, data science, general-purpose
- **Node.js** - Express, Fastify, async JavaScript
- **Java** - Spring Boot, enterprise applications
- **Go** - Concurrent, cloud-native applications
- **Rust** - Memory safety, performance, systems programming
- **PHP** - Laravel, modern patterns

### Mobile Languages
- **Swift** - iOS development, SwiftUI, async/await
- **Kotlin** - Android development, concurrency
- **Dart** - Flutter cross-platform development

### Data & AI
- **Python** - Dominant in ML/data science
- **R** - Statistical computing
- **SQL** - Database querying (essential for all)

### Specialized
- **Solidity** - Smart contracts on Ethereum
- **C++** - Games, performance-critical
- **GDScript** - Godot game engine
- **Bash/Shell** - System administration, scripting

## Quick Start

1. Choose your primary language based on domain
2. Master fundamentals (variables, functions, control flow)
3. Learn language idioms and best practices
4. Study ecosystem (frameworks, libraries)
5. Practice with real projects

## Modern Language Features

- **Type Safety** - TypeScript, Go, Rust
- **Async/Await** - JavaScript, Python, Rust
- **Pattern Matching** - Rust, Go, Scala
- **Memory Management** - Garbage collection vs ownership
- **Concurrency Models** - Threads, async, channels, goroutines

## Recommended Learning Path

1. Start with Python or JavaScript (friendliest)
2. Add TypeScript for type safety
3. Learn a compiled language (Go, Rust, or Java)
4. Domain-specific language (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android, etc.)
5. Master standard library and ecosystem
